# Analysis and Challenges 
## Overview of the project
The motive for this project was to assist Louis in having a better understanding with trends on crowdfunding campaigns. Lousi will set up a project campaign to fund the play, "Fever". 

## Analysis on Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date 
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92067596/154824969-18cd1e43-0ea5-4e32-b979-ee7e968838fc.png)

In the first analysis I related how the outcome was affected by the length of the campaign starting from the launch date to the completion date. The length given was in Unix Timestamps that I converted to DD/MM/YY making it easier to understand.  I also filtered out, success rate and plays in subcategories because with both types of information it would relate to what her investigation is looking for. 

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The information collected was the number of successful, failed and cancelled plays that fall into a certain range if the goal was accomplished. Also, there was a distribution in the total of projects with their specific goal amount. There was a calculation done for the percentage of successful, failed and canceled project as well leading to create another visual display of how the goal amount affected the outcome. 

## What are the two conclusions that you can draw about the outcomes based on the launch date? 
- May was the most successful month in the Kickstarter campaign data set. 
- There was a low successful and failed outcome towards the beginning and end of year. 

## What can you conclude the outcomes based on goals? 
- When the goal amount went to the highest there was a significant difference between successful and failed rate.
- $3,500 - $4,500 is the most stable amount Louise can use for her funding goal.  

## What are some limitations on this data set? 
Not enough information on the theater projects, therefore low probabilities in retrieving sufficient information about their successful campaigns. 

## What are some other possible tables and /or graphs that we would create?

- The theater does indeed have more plays than musicals or uses it for space. This was also filtered within the GB where, but global statistics has a reputation of being more attracted to plays.
